# SuiSecureDrop 🛡️

## Overview
SuiSecureDrop is a professional, non-custodial decentralized protocol built on the Sui blockchain. It provides a secure "Pending State" for asset transfers, allowing users to send SUI and NFTs (artifacts) with PIN-based authentication. Unlike traditional transfers, this protocol grants senders the power to recall assets if they haven't been claimed, ensuring total peace of mind against human error or address typos.

## Features
- **Vault Encapsulation**: Assets are moved into a smart-contract-controlled object rather than directly to a recipient.
- **PIN Protection**: Claims require a 4-digit PIN, which is hashed on-chain using SHA3-256 for maximum security.
- **Atomic Recalls**: Senders can instantly pull back funds/items as long as the recipient has not yet claimed them.
- **NFT Support**: Capability to send up to two artifacts (Move objects) alongside SUI in a single secure drop.
- **Responsive Interface**: A sleek, high-tech dashboard designed for both desktop and mobile wallet browsers.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the development environment locally.

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Emafido/Suiproject.git
   cd Suiproject
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure the Smart Contract**
   The project is configured to run on the Sui Devnet. If you redeploy the Move contract, update the constants in `src/constants.js`:
   ```javascript
   export const PACKAGE_ID = "0xfd8f81488f21da9346b634f1a0a568ddd291745b9e1bd372c9d9b37d34c703de"; 
   export const MODULE_NAME = "secure_drop";
   ```

4. **Launch the Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage
### 1. Connecting Your Wallet
Launch the application and connect your Sui Wallet. If you are on mobile, use the internal browser within the Sui Wallet app to interact with the protocol.

### 2. Creating a Secure Drop
- Navigate to the **New Drop** section.
- Input the recipient's Sui address and the amount of SUI you wish to lock.
- (Optional) Select up to 2 items from your "Vault Artifacts" to include in the package.
- Set a secret 4-digit PIN and click **Encrypt & Send**.

### 3. Claiming a Package
As a recipient, check your **Inbox**. You will see the incoming secure package. Enter the PIN provided to you by the sender and click **Unlock** to move the assets into your wallet.

### 4. Recalling Funds
If you sent a package to the wrong person or changed your mind, go to your **Dashboard**, locate the active delivery, and click **Recall Funds**. This transaction is atomic and returns everything to your wallet instantly.
